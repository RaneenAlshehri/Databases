# UniversityLibrary Databases
The main objective of our project is to facilitate the process of borrowing books from the library.

## Problems
Many students face a problem in buying books due to their high prices, and students 
may need some books, but they are sometimes not available in libraries, and libraries 
are outside working hours and may cause a problem for many students because they 
need to borrow or buy books at outside working hours.

## Solutions
And due to the many problems that students may face, the university library has 
provided a wonderful feature, which is the digital library, where the digital library helps 
students to book books via the Internet without the need to wait for the libraryâ€™s working 
hours, as the digital library provides the books that the student needs, and when he By 
booking books through the digital university library, he can go and receive the book 
without having to wait for a long time, as the goal of the digital library is to save effort, 
money and time for students.
